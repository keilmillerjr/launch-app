by Keil Miller Jr [Keil Miller Jr](http://keilmillerjr.com)

## DESCRIPTION:

Launch is an app for the [AttractMode](http://attractmode.org) front end. It will launch AttractMode while hiding the console window, intended to be used in a home production setting. For development, attract.exe may still be run directly to show the console window.

## Requirements:

* AttractMode for Windows OS installed

## Install Files

1. Copy launch32.exe (32-bit) or launch64.exe (64-bit) to the same directory as attract.exe inside your AttractMode directory. Launch will not work if placed in any other directory.

## Notes

Command Line Parameters may be passed to the launch app, and will be forwarded to attract.exe.
